#Overview
Right now we only know about RED and BLUE. We need to figure out who is actually
making the decisions for each of these players. Is it the user, or a computer program.

We won't need to change the model. The model just needs to know that someone wants to place a card at a
position, and it will either say that that is legal or will stop you from doing it.

we will observe what the game state is:
state of board
state of hand
state of scores
and see the turns of the players

After we need to decide what we want to do:
We can either place a card or pass the turn

After we do that we need to get the feedback:
Did the move succeed?
throw error if it does not and tell us why?
Check if the game is over if both

The player will return an action
not moving the card themselves but will just say what they want

the model will read this

then will give them feedback

Players turn:
show them the board and cards
the person will do there move and will either succeed or fail

AI turn:
Look at the possible moves and pick randomly
then return


looping:
Turn
ask the move they want to do
try move
and return if it worked or not
then switch turns

This will work for Human and AI
