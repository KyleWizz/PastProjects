# Past Projects Repository
-This repository is of my recent projects in the past few years.
-I included projects I worked on in school, however I have more that I worked on and do not have access to right now (my pytorch project) as they are on my other device and I have to find it.
-Adding more projects as the year goes by, consistently working.
#Mars Rover Challenge URC
-I am a part of my universities Mars Rover Challenge working in part with the life detection team to build a spectrometer software, and I work with my team on other sections of our codebase on our rover such as the UI and backend of autonomous.
-My main goals for this semester is to have our software read inputs from our spectrometer, and output them in readable form. My software will read the inputs from the lightwaves of our soil samples, and take in the firmwares readings to make graphs and clean data, allowing us to identify potential biosignatures.
#Aerospace NU
-Currently, we're integrating our PID controller with a needle valve, processing sensor inputs and tuning control parameters to achieve precise flow regulation. I am developing skills in C++, and also how to work with firmware in a hands-on practical setting. Our current launch date for our rocket is in Spring of 2027.

#Side note
-I have many projects in python that unfortunately were deleted with my old repl.it account, however I do have experience working with many python libraries as I stated in my resume. I am also working on a data science project right now for one of my classes which I will promptly add as soon as I am done. In this group project, I am working to write a machine learning predictive model using python and jupyter, however I also have experience in collab and VScode when it comes to data analysis.
